# SDG 7 and AI Solution for MacDonald's

## 1. Forecasting Demand and Optimizing Production

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Data Collection]-->B[Data Analysis];
  B-->C[Production Optimization];
  C-->D[Production];
  D-->E[Sales];
```

## 2. Dynamic Pricing Based on Inventory Levels

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Data Collection]-->B[Data Analysis];
  B-->C[Price Optimization];
  C-->D[Sales];
  D-->E[Inventory];
```

## 3. Calculating Delivery Route and Assigning to Nearest Delivery Person

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Order Received]-->B[Data Collection];
  B-->C[Delivery Optimization];
  C-->D[Delivery Assignment];
  D-->E[Delivery];
```

In the first flowchart, data is collected and analyzed to optimize production and sales based on demand forecasts. In the second flowchart, data is collected and analyzed to optimize pricing based on inventory levels, with the goal of maximizing sales while minimizing waste. In the third flowchart, order data is collected and analyzed to optimize delivery routes and assign orders to the nearest available delivery person, with the goal of reducing delivery times and increasing customer satisfaction.
