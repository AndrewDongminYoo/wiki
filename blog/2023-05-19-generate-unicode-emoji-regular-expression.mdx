# Generate Unicode emoji regular expression

## Question

```plaintext
⚙ <fe0f> gear Unicode: `U+2699` `U+FE0F`, `UTF-8: E2 9A 99 EF B8 8F`
```

Write a regular expression that matches all Unicode emojis of this type.

## Answer

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a regular expression that matches all Unicode emojis of this type:

```RegExp
\u2699[\uFE0E\uFE0F]
```

This regular expression matches the gear Unicode character (`U+2699`) followed by either the text presentation selector (`U+FE0E`) or the emoji presentation
selector (`U+FE0F`). The "g" at the end of the regular expression means that it will match all occurrences of this pattern in a given string.

Write a regular expression that matches all Unicode emojis of this type.

## Answer

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a regular expression that matches all Unicode emojis of this type:

```RegExp
[\u{1f600}-\u{1f64f}]
```

This regular expression uses the Unicode code point range for emoticons, which is U+1F600 to U+1F64F. The `/u` flag at the end of the expression enables
Unicode mode in JavaScript, which allows the matching of Unicode characters beyond the BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane).

This regular expression will match all emojis of this type, including smileys, people, animals, and other objects.

## Answer

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a regular expression that matches all Unicode emoji characters:

- `\u{1F000}-\u{1F6FF}`: 기타 기호 및 그림, 이모티콘, 교통 및 지도 기호 등.
- `\u{1F900}-\u{1F9FF}`: 보조 기호 및 픽토그램.
