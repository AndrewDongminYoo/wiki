# Turbo Native Modules 路 React Native

## Migrating React Native library to Turbo Modules

Migrating your React Native library to use Turbo Modules, which is part of the new architecture of React Native, can provide several benefits. Turbo Modules are the next iteration on Native Modules and provide a few extra benefits such as strongly typed interfaces that are consistent across platforms, the ability to write your code in C++, either exclusively or integrated with another native platform language, reducing the need to duplicate implementations across platforms, lazy loading of modules, allowing for faster app startup and more efficient communication between native and JavaScript code than the bridge.
