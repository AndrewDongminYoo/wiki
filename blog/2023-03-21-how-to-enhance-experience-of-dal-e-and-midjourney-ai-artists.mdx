# How to enhance experience of Dal-E and Midjourney AI artists?

## 이미지 생성 AI를 사용해봐야 할 이유

Dal-E와 미드저니는 인공지능 미술가로서 많은 사람들이 이용하고 있습니다. 이들은 다양한 스타일의 작품을 만들어내며, 사용자의 요구에 따라 맞춤형 작품을 제작할 수도 있습니다. 이러한 기술은 예술의 세계에서 새로운 가능성을 열어주고 있습니다.

인공지능 화가들은 일반적인 대화형 인공지능과 접근성이 비슷합니다. 인터넷 검색을 통해 다양한 인공지능 미술가들의 작품을 볼 수 있습니다. 가격은 다양하며, 작품마다 차이가 있습니다. 예를 들어 한 예술가는 미술 경연에서 AI를 통해 생성한 그림으로 300달러를 벌었습니다.

## 무료 플랜에서의 한계

Midjourney는 Discord 서버에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 무료 요금 한도 내에서 이미지를 생성하는 것이 가능합니다. 예를 들어, `/imagine` 명령어를 사용하여 이미지를 생성할 수 있습니다. 또한, 특정한 예술가의 스타일을 지정하여 이미지를 생성할 수도 있습니다. 예를 들어 `/imagine fisherman looking out at the ocean, standing in his boat, davinci style` 이라는 명령어로 다빈치 스타일의 어부 이미지를 생성할 수 있습니다.

## 사이버펑크/과학공상물 영감을 주는 프롬프트 ("30년 뒤 현대인의 한끼 식사")

### Prompt "A meal for modern people 30 years from now" version 01.

"In a bustling cyberpunk cityscape, a woman sits at a sleek, high-tech table in her apartment. In front of her is a plate of food that looks almost unrecognizable - an array of colorful, geometric shapes made from lab-grown ingredients and 3D-printed to perfection. She takes a bite with her smart utensils, which analyze the nutritional content and flavor profile in real-time. As she eats, holographic displays around her show the latest news and entertainment."

### Prompt "A meal for modern people 30 years from now" version 02.

"In a world ravaged by climate change and extreme weather events, food production has become increasingly difficult. A man sits alone in his small apartment, staring at the single nutrition bar that constitutes his entire meal. It's designed to provide all the essential nutrients he needs to survive, but it's bland and unappetizing. He takes a bite and chews slowly, remembering the days when he could enjoy a variety of flavors and textures. Outside his window, the sky is gray and polluted."

### Prompt "A meal for modern people 30 years from now" version 03.

"In a dimly lit room, a group of people sit around a table, listlessly eating their nutrition bars made from ground insects and other unidentifiable ingredients. Their expressions are blank and their movements mechanical as they chew the tasteless bars. Suddenly, a holographic display flickers to life above the table, showing an advertisement for a new line of gourmet nutrition bars - designed for foodies and boasting real flavor. The people at the table stare at the display with wide eyes and slack jaws, as if seeing something miraculous for the first time."

### Prompt "A meal for modern people 30 years from now" version 04.

"In a crowded and run-down room in a poor country, a group of teenagers huddle around an old-fashioned stand-alone digital TV. On the screen, a flashy advertisement plays for a new food product - zero-something - that promises to satisfy all cravings for sugar and fat without any negative health consequences. The teenagers watch with wide eyes and open mouths, unable to understand the words but mesmerized by the bright colors and tantalizing images of food. Their stomachs growl with hunger as they dream of tasting something so delicious."

### Prompt "A meal for modern people 30 years from now" version 05.

"In a world where climate change and overpopulation have pushed humanity to the brink, a family gathers around a small table in their cramped apartment. The meal they share is simple and unremarkable - lab-grown protein and hydroponically grown vegetables - but it's enough to sustain them. They eat in silence, grateful for what they have but worried about the future. Outside their window, the city sprawls endlessly, a concrete jungle teeming with people and pollution."

### Prompt "A meal for modern people 30 years from now" version 06.

"In a future where advanced technology has made it possible to pack all the necessary nutrients and rich flavors into a single sheet of edible paper, a woman sits alone in her small apartment. She takes a bite of the paper and savors the taste, but there's a sadness in her eyes. This high-tech food product, once considered a luxury, is now all she can afford as prices for animal-based products have skyrocketed beyond her reach. Outside her window, the wealthy dine on real meat and dairy while she can only dream of such extravagance."

### Prompt "A meal for modern people 30 years from now" version 07.

"In a future where climate taxes have made animal-based and inefficiently grown crops a luxury only the wealthy can afford, a man sits in a fine dining restaurant. He tears into his steak with greasy fingers and relishes every bite, knowing that this is the height of culinary indulgence. Across town, in a small apartment, a woman puts on her virtual reality headset and enters the metaverse. There she can experience the sights and smells of decadent food while in reality she eats her nutritionally complete but flavorless edible paper. Once considered cutting-edge molecular gastronomy is now all she can afford."

### Prompt "A meal for modern people 30 years from now" version 08.

"In a future where food has become more than just sustenance, a group of friends gather in a trendy restaurant. They order dishes made from ingredients that have been genetically modified to enhance their emotions and experiences. As they eat, they laugh and cry and feel more alive than ever before. Across town, in a laboratory, scientists work tirelessly to create new and more powerful food-based experiences. But as the line between nourishment and entertainment blurs, some begin to question the ethics of manipulating emotions through food."
