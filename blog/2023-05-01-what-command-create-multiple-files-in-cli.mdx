# what-command-create-multiple-files-in-cli

```sh
ygka "What command can you use to tell the CLI to create files A1.md through A10.md in one folder?"
```

To create files A1.md through A10.md in one folder using the command-line interface (CLI), you can use a command called "touch" along with brace expansion. Here's an example of the command you can use:

```sh
touch A{1..10}.md
```

This command will create 10 files in the current directory with the names A1.md through A10.md. The "touch" command is used to create empty files, and the brace expansion syntax `{1..10}` is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10.
